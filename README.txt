To run the code, 

1. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command in the terminal:
```
source mediapipe_venv/bin/activate
```

2. Open 2023CSB1104_CS517_PA2.ipynb in a Jupyter notebook.

3. Type in relevant paths for src image and dst image.

4. Using appropriate argument for tie point acquisition, run the code.
    
    ie. "mp", "mpa", "dlib", "dliba", "click", "txt"

5. For text input, save the tie points as tie.txt in the same directory as the code.

Please note that I could not get dlib and mediapipe to work simultaneously in the virtual environment. Hence, I have provided the code for dlib and mediapipe separately. It can be uncommented if needed.
